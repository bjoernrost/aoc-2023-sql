I have wanted to do a bit of coding again for a while, and [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is presenting a great opportunity to do so. Inspired by [another project](https://github.com/mitchellh/advent-2021-sql), I want to solve the challenges using PostgreSQL-specific SQL on AlloyDB.
